## ü§ù Getting Help

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to pay for Vapi?**
A: They offer a free trial. After that, pricing is per-minute of voice calls.

**Q: Can multiple people use this?**
A: Yes! Each person can track their own progress if you implement authentication.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: No, it requires internet for voice AI (Vapi) and database (Supabase).

**Q: How accurate is the performance analysis?**
A: The basic version uses heuristics. For better accuracy, integrate OpenAI (see API_INTEGRATION.md).
