# Fix Summary: User Profile Creation Error

## Problem
Users encountered an error `Error creating user profile: {}` during signup. The error occurred because the database's Row Level Security (RLS) policies were incomplete.

## Root Cause
The `users` table had RLS enabled but only included a SELECT policy. When new users tried to sign up, the `upsert` operation (which requires INSERT and UPDATE permissions) was blocked by RLS, causing the profile creation to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`)
- ✅ Added INSERT policy: Allows users to create their own profile during signup
- ✅ Added UPDATE policy: Allows users to update their own profile information
- ✅ Maintained existing SELECT policy: Users can read their own data

### 2. Improved Error Handling (`lib/auth.tsx`)
- ✅ Enhanced error logging to display detailed error information:
  - Error message
  - Error code
  - Error details
  - Error hints
- ✅ Better distinction between database errors and caught exceptions

### 3. Migration Script (`migrations/fix_user_rls_policies.sql`)
- ✅ Created standalone migration script for existing databases
- ✅ Can be run independently to fix RLS policies without recreating tables

### 4. Documentation Updates (`README.md`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive troubleshooting section
- ✅ Documented the specific fix for user profile creation errors
- ✅ Added general authentication and voice call troubleshooting
- ✅ Referenced migrations folder in setup instructions

## How to Apply the Fix

### For Existing Databases
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the SQL from `migrations/fix_user_rls_policies.sql`
4. Test signup functionality

### For New Databases
1. Run the complete `DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
2. All policies are now included automatically

## Files Modified
- `grassroots-training/DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` - Added RLS policies
- `grassroots-training/lib/auth.tsx` - Improved error logging
- `grassroots-training/README.md` - Added troubleshooting documentation

## Files Created
- `grassroots-training/migrations/fix_user_rls_policies.sql` - Migration script
- `phone-banker-training/FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Try signing up with a new account
2. The user profile should be created successfully
3. No "Error creating user profile" should appear in the console
4. User should be able to sign in and access the dashboard

## Technical Details

### RLS Policies Added
```sql
-- Allow users to insert their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own data" ON users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow users to update their own profile  
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own data" ON users
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

These policies ensure that:
- Users can only create profiles for themselves (their auth.uid() matches the id)
- Users can only update their own profile data
- Security is maintained through Supabase's built-in RLS system
