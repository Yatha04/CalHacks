## 🎯 Problem Statement

Phone banking volunteers often face challenges:
- Anxiety about calling strangers
- Uncertainty about handling objections
- Lack of practice before real calls
- No feedback on performance
- Difficulty improving skills

**Solution**: A safe training environment with AI-powered simulations and detailed performance analytics.
